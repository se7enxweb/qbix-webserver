## Q_Sapi — SAPI emulation for forked children

A forked child of a CLI process has no SAPI. Nothing populated the superglobals, nothing captures output, and native `header()` is a silent no-op. `Q_Sapi` does what mod_php or php-fpm would do:

```php
Q_Sapi::enter($parsed);      // superglobals + ob_start include $scriptPath
;         // any PHP file, not just a front controller list($status, $headers, $body) = Q_Sapi::leave();
```

`enter()` populates `$_GET`, `$_POST` (form-encoded or JSON), `$_COOKIE`, `$_FILES` and `$_SERVER` — including `HTTP_HOST`, `SCRIPT_NAME`, `PATH_INFO` and `REMOTE_ADDR`. `HTTP_HOST` matters more than it looks: `Q_Response::setCookie()` returns false without it, which silently drops the session cookie.

### Shutdown ordering

PHP runs `register_shutdown_function` callbacks in registration order, then object destructors. Since `Q_Sapi` registers before any application code, a shutdown callback would fire *first* — before user callbacks had a chance to echo or set cookies. So capture happens in a **destructor** (`Q_Sapi_Finalizer`), which is guaranteed to run last and still runs on `exit()`, on uncaught exceptions and on fatal errors.

Before assembling the response, `capture()` calls `session_write_close()` explicitly, so the session row and its cookie are settled rather than racing a response the parent has already sent.

`capture()` is idempotent, and `deliver()` hands the response off exactly once — to `Q_Sapi::$onCapture` if the worker pool registered a consumer, otherwise to `STDOUT` so a child run standalone behaves like an ordinary PHP script.

### What fork mode cannot do

Native `header()` cannot be intercepted: in the CLI SAPI it does nothing, and PHP offers no hook. Fork mode therefore fully supports code that goes through `Q_Response::header()` / `Q::header()`. Third-party or legacy scripts that call `header()` directly should be routed to `php-cgi` with `Q.webserver.cgi.patterns` — that config is the supported escape hatch, not a workaround.

## Setting headers, status codes and cookies

**Use `Q_Response`.** It works in both standalone and `--app` mode and has the same signature as PHP's built-in `header()`:

```php
Q_Response::header('Content-Type: application/json');
Q_Response::header('X-Custom: hello');
Q_Response::header('HTTP/1.1 201 Created');   // status line form Q_Response::code(201)
;                         // or set it directly Q_Response::setCookie('session', $token, 0, '/');
Q_Response::redirect('/dashboard');
```

`Q_Response::header()` also works — `Q_Response::header()` delegates to it — but `Q_Response` is the higher-level API that scripts should prefer.

### Why not `header()`?

PHP's built-in `header()` and `http_response_code()` are **silently discarded** under the CLI SAPI, which is what the server runs in. `headers_list()` always returns an empty array and `http_response_code()` returns `false`, and PHP offers no hook to intercept the builtins. A script calling them gets a `200` with none of its headers, and no error to explain why.

### What works where

| API | standalone | `--app` | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Q_Response::header()` | ✅ | ✅ | **recommended** — delegates to `Q_WebServer_State`, same signature as PHP's `header()` |
| `Q_Response::code()` | ✅ | ✅ | get or set the HTTP status code |
| `Q_Response::setCookie()` | ✅ | ✅ | cookies are assembled into `Set-Cookie` headers by the server |
| `Q_Response::header()` | ✅ | ✅ | low-level — `Q_Response::header()` delegates here |
| `Q::header()` | ✅ | ✅ | alias for `Q_Response::header()` |
| `header()` (built-in) | ❌ | ❌ | silently discarded by the CLI SAPI |
| `http_response_code()` | ❌ | ❌ | silently discarded by the CLI SAPI |

### Scripts you don't control

Third-party code — WordPress, a vendored SDK, anything not written for Qbix — will call native `header()`. Route it to `php-cgi`, which runs it in a real CGI process where the builtins work normally:

```json
{ "Q": { "webserver": { "cgi": { "patterns": ["wp-.*\\.php", "legacy/.*"] } } } }
```

`tests/run-cgi.sh` proves that path preserves both status codes and headers.

### Cookies

`Q_Response::setCookie()` works in both modes (the Platform declares it too). The server reads `Q_Response::$cookies` — a `public static` property on both implementations — and emits the `Set-Cookie` headers itself.

## Remembered file facts

To make `header()`, `exit` and the rest work under the CLI SAPI, the server
rewrites the PHP it includes and replaces PHP's `file://` stream handler with its
own (`Q_WebServer_CompatFileWrapper`). Every file operation the application makes
then runs through PHP code instead of C: an include, a `file_exists()`, an
`fopen()`. A content management system asks about the same files again and again
while it renders one page -- on the front page of an Exponential installation, 2600
existence checks about 700 distinct paths -- so what the wrapper has already found
out is remembered.

### What a worker remembers, and until when

A pool worker remembers, for the rest of the request:

- a file's full stat and, for an include, its mtime and size;
- whether a path exists and whether it is a directory (the answer `file_exists()`,
  `is_dir()` and `is_file()` give, since the transform sends those three to the
  wrapper);
- the bytes of an included file and its transformed source, checked against the
  remembered mtime and size before use.

All of it is forgotten -- at once, not at the end of the request -- when:

| Event | Why it must forget |
|---|---|
| A file is written, renamed, removed or touched through the wrapper, or a directory created or removed | The answer it had is now wrong. |
| The application calls `clearstatcache()` | That is exactly what the call asks for. Exponential's `eZFSFileHandler::loadMetaData($force)` does it before looking at a cache file another request may have regenerated. |
| The application runs another program: `exec()`, `system()`, `passthru()`, `shell_exec()`, `proc_close()` or `pclose()` | The program can create, change or remove files the wrapper never sees. Exponential makes image variations with ImageMagick through `system()` and then checks for the file it expects; a remembered "not there" would call the new image missing. |
| The request ends | Unless `Q.compat.statTtl` says to keep them a little longer (below). |
| A worker is forked | What the parent knew describes the moment of the fork. A new worker always starts with nothing remembered. |

The six process functions are rewritten by the same transform that rewrites
`header()`: the call goes to a shim (`Q_WebServer_Compat::_exec()` and so on) that
runs the real function with the same arguments -- output arrays and exit codes
passed back unchanged -- and then forgets. Only global calls are rewritten: a
method that happens to be called `exec()` (`$pdo->exec()`, `PDO::exec()`,
`$s?->system()`) is left alone. A shell command in backticks is not a function
call and is not seen; use `shell_exec()` in code that creates files and then
checks for them.

Existence answers are remembered **only in pool workers**, which have a request
boundary to forget at. The server process keeps the wrapper for its whole life and
has no such boundary, so it asks every time: a remembered "not there" in the
server would never be forgotten (the response cache's generation marker, created
after the first look, was never seen when it did).

Measured on an Exponential front page (one request at a time, six alternating
rounds against the engine without it): real existence checks went from 2605 to
696 per page, and CPU per rendered page fell by about 5%.
`tests/unit-compat-existence-memo.php` covers every rule above.

### Keeping them across requests: `Q.compat.statTtl`

```json
{ "Q": { "compat": { "statTtl": 1 } } }
```

`statTtl` is the number of seconds, at most 10, that a worker keeps what it knows
about files across request boundaries -- the same trade `opcache.revalidate_freq`
makes for compiled scripts. It is `0` by default, which forgets at every boundary.

With a TTL, everything in the table above still forgets at once, except the end of
a request: the worker's own writes, `clearstatcache()` and a program it ran are
seen immediately. Only a change made by **another process** -- another worker, a
web server sharing the files (Apache next to Velocity), an editor, a deploy -- can
go unseen, for at most the TTL. A freshly forked worker forgets regardless.

Measured on the same page with `statTtl` set to `1`: about 13% less CPU per
rendered page, lower in all six rounds. Exponential sets it from `velocity.ini`
`[ServerSettings] StatTtl`.

Set it when files change through deploys and the application itself, and a change
made by hand showing up to a second later is acceptable. Leave it at `0` while
developing against files an editor is changing, or when another process writes
files the application must see the instant they appear.

## Tests

Five test suites, 152 tests total:

```bash
# Core — static files, MIME, PHP dispatch, superglobals, POST/JSON, cookies, auth, stress
bash tests/run.sh --quick                    # 72 tests

# SAPI — superglobal population, output capture, status codes, sessions, shutdown ordering
php tests/testSapi.php                       # 19 tests

# HTTP protocol — keep-alive, path traversal, ETags, encoding, logging, panel auth
bash tests/testHttp.sh [port]                # 37 tests

# WebSocket — RFC 6455, Socket.IO handshake, events+acks, rooms, dashboard broadcast
node tests/testWebSocket.js [port]           # 12 tests

# Snapshot reset — octane state isolation, memory leaks, secret leaks
bash tests/testSnapshot.sh [port]            # 12 tests
```

The snapshot tests start both a fork-mode server and a persistent-worker server, then verify that statics, globals, `$_COOKIE`, `$_SERVER`, `$_POST`, Authorization headers, and response headers from request A are invisible to request B. The fork-mode server acts as a control group. See [reset.md](docs/reset.md) for what the snapshot resets.

## Class ownership in `--app` mode

The webserver owns its own classes; the Platform does not carry copies.

`Q::autoload()` resolves `Q_WebServer_Proxy` to `classes/Q/WebServer/Proxy.php` against PHP's include_path, which covers only the Platform. So `qbixserver.php` registers a prepended autoloader that serves these names from this repo's `src/`:

    Q_WebServer, Q_WebServer_*, Q_WebSocket, Q_Scheduler, Q_FileCache, Q_HotReload

It is deliberately **selective**. `src/Q/` also contains `Utils`, `Uri`, `Evented` and `Snapshot`, which the Platform also defines. Claiming those would shadow the Platform's versions with the standalone ones. In `--app` mode the Platform wins for anything it defines; we claim only what is ours alone.

Do **not** copy `Q/WebServer*.php` into `platform/classes/`. Nothing in the Platform references `Q_WebServer` except one comment, and a Platform running behind nginx or php-fpm should not ship code it never loads. A partial copy there is worse than none: it shadows this repo's complete set and fails with `Class "Q_WebServer_Proxy" not found`.

### `Q::$paths`

`Q::$paths` is declared by this repo's **standalone shim** (`src/Q.php`), not by the Platform's `Q.php`. Use `Q_WebServer::paths()` instead of touching the property — it falls back to `APP_DIR`/`Q_DIR` when the property is absent. Dereferencing it directly in `--app` mode raised `Access to undeclared static property Q::$paths` and made every request a 500.

### The webserver is a strict, overridable subset

In `--app` mode the Platform wins twice over: its **classes** override ours for any shared name, and its **config** (routing, etc.) overrides ours. That is the intended direction, and it only works if we never depend on anything the Platform lacks.

The rule: **any member the Platform does not define must live on a webserver-only class** — `Q_WebServer`, `Q_WebServer_*`, `Q_WebSocket`, `Q_Scheduler`, `Q_FileCache`, `Q_HotReload` — never on a shared name like `Q`, `Q_Utils`, `Q_Uri`, `Q_Evented` or `Q_Snapshot`.

`tests/platform-compat.php` enforces this. It maps both class trees, finds the shared names, and fails if we touch a static member the Platform's version does not declare. Guarded calls (`method_exists('Q','init') && Q::init(...)`) are allowed, since they degrade cleanly.

    php tests/platform-compat.php /path/to/Qbix/platform

Fixed under this rule so far:

- `Q::$paths` — declared by our standalone shim, not by the Platform. Now read
  through `Q_WebServer::paths()`, which falls back to `APP_DIR`/`Q_DIR`.
- `Q_Utils::serverIdentity()`, `serverClaim()`, `signClaim()`, `verify()` —
  four methods on a shared class name the Platform also defines (without them). Moved to **`Q_WebServer_Identity`**.

#### Platform compatibility: PASS

`php tests/platform-compat.php <platform>` reports **0 violations**. All webserver-only methods (`setInput`, `restoreInput`, `getHeaders`, `cookieHeaders`, `clear`, `responseCode`) are called on `Q_WebServer_State` (webserver-only class), never on shared classes that the Platform overrides. The webserver's internal code uses `Q_WebServer_State` for state management; user-facing APIs (`Q_Response::header()`, `Q_Request::method()`, etc.) exist in both the standalone shim and the Platform.

### Why the webserver keeps its own Q_Uri (measured)

| | bytes | dependencies |
|---|---|---|
| Platform `Q_Uri` | 41,394 (1,472 lines) | `Q`, `Q_Config`, `Q_Request`, `Q_Utils`, `Q_Valid` |
| webserver `Q_Uri` | 7,554 | `Q`, `Q_Config` |

Adopting the Platform's outright means its **transitive closure**: Uri 41K + Request 55K + Utils 84K + Valid 17K = **~197KB**, versus 7.5KB — and the webserver has no `Q_Valid` at all. A standalone static server does not need slots, mobile detection or validation to match `AI/webhook/:type/:task`.

In `--app` mode the calculus reverses: the Platform is already loaded, so its `Q_Uri` is free and ours is dead weight. Hence `Q_WebServer_Router`, which uses whichever is present.

**Resolved.** `Q_Uri::from()` *is* the path→route matcher — it dispatches internally to the protected `fromUrl()`. The catch is that it must be given an **absolute URL**, not a bare path.

Passing a bare path is worse than an error. `from()` then treats it as a URI string (`"Module/action/..."`) and merely SPLITS it, returning a wrong answer with no exception. Measured against a live app:

    bare path  AI/webhook/slack/ingest                    -> AI / webhook/slack/ingest   (split) full URL   http://host/App/AI/webhook/slack/ingest    -> AI / webhook                (routed)

`Q_WebServer_Router` now builds `Q_Request::baseUrl() + path` before calling `from()`, and returns null rather than guessing when no base URL is available. Verified with the Platform's `Q_Uri` loaded (`which Q_Uri: PLATFORM`):

    /AI/webhook/slack/ingest  -> AI/webhook /Safebox/action           -> Safebox/action /Users/login              -> null      (no catch-all route in that app's config) /nope                     -> null

## Testing

Seven suites. Everything runs against a real server over a real socket — no mocks.

    bash tests/run.sh --quick                    # 71 functional + security tests php  tests/testSapi.php                      # 19 SAPI emulation tests bash tests/run-probe.sh [platform-dir]       # 58 wire-level probes per mode bash tests/run-cgi.sh                        # php-cgi carveout php  tests/platform-compat.php <platform>    # --app compatibility audit php  tests/routing-parity.php  <platform>    # our matcher vs the Platform's bash tests/run-modes.sh <app> <platform>     # dual-mode acceptance

CI runs all of them on every push (`.github/workflows/test.yml`), in three jobs: standalone, php-cgi, and `--app` against a fresh checkout of [Qbix/Platform](https://github.com/Qbix/Platform).

### Testing `--app` mode

The Platform will not bootstrap without a real app — it needs a config with `Q/plugins` and `Q/web/appRootUrl`, and its `Q_Uri` is not loadable on its own. Build a minimal, plugin-free fixture:

    bash tests/fixtures/make-app.sh /path/to/Platform/platform /tmp/TestApp 20099 bash tests/run-probe.sh /path/to/Platform/platform

Without a Platform path, `platform-compat.php` and `routing-parity.php` exit 0 with `SKIP`. **In CI that is indistinguishable from passing**, so the workflow greps their output and fails the job if they did not actually report success.

### `tests/probe.php` — the wire-level suite

Unit tests miss whole classes of bug. Two examples this suite caught that nothing else did:

- **`exit()` sent the client zero bytes.** The forked child unwound past the
  response-writing code, so nothing reached the socket — while the access log recorded `200`, because the parent had already assumed success.
- **Headers were silently dropped in `--app` mode.** They were captured
  correctly, then discarded by a guard that tested for a method only the standalone shim declares.

Both looked fine from inside the process. Only reading the socket revealed them.

### `tests/platform-compat.php` — the invariant that matters

The webserver is a *subset* the Platform must be able to override. In `--app` mode the Platform's classes win for every name it defines, so any member the webserver touches on a shared class must exist in the Platform's version too — otherwise it works standalone and dies under a real app.

This audit walks `src/` **and the test fixtures** (they run under both modes too) and fails on any member a shared class does not declare. Anything the Platform lacks belongs on a webserver-only class: `Q_WebServer`, `Q_WebServer_State`, `Q_WebServer_Router`, `Q_WebServer_Identity`, `Q_WebSocket`, `Q_Scheduler`, `Q_FileCache`, `Q_HotReload`.

### Two behaviours worth knowing

**`php://input` works, via a stream wrapper.** A forking server reads the request off the socket itself, so the real `php://input` is already consumed and would stay empty for the life of the process. `Q_WebServer_State::setInput()` registers a wrapper over `php` so `file_get_contents('php://input')` returns *this* request's body, and `restoreInput()` unregisters it afterwards.

The wrapper class exists twice on purpose: `Q_PhpInputStream` in `src/Q.php` for standalone, and `Q_WebServer_PhpInput` for `--app`, because `src/Q.php` is the standalone shim and is not loaded when the Platform's `Q` wins. Without the webserver-owned copy, `php://input` returned an empty string for every request under `--app`.

**Native `header()` is discarded under the CLI SAPI.** `headers_list()` always returns empty and `http_response_code()` returns `false`; PHP offers no hook to intercept the builtin. Scripts written for Qbix should use `Q_Response::header()`, which works in both modes. Scripts that must use native `header()` — WordPress, third-party code — are routed to `php-cgi` via `Q.webserver.cgi.patterns`; `tests/run-cgi.sh` proves that path preserves both status and headers.

**The app enforces its own baseUrl.** If the app is configured for `http://host/App` and you serve it on another port, the Platform returns `{"error":"bad url ..."}`. That is the application refusing, not the server failing. Serve at the configured address, or point the app's baseUrl at the listening one — which is what `make-app.sh`'s port argument does.

### Fixed: `/` returned 403 in `--app` mode

`GET /index.php` returns 200 and renders the app. `GET /` returns 403.

Narrowed to the directory-index lookup: for `/` the server resolves the docroot directory and then tries `index.html`, `index.php` in turn. That lookup is not finding `web/index.php` even though the file exists and serves correctly when requested directly — so the request falls past the index branch and is refused. Suspect the `$fsPath . DS . $idx` join against `self::$rootDir` (the startup banner reports `Root: web`, a relative value).

Everything else in `--app` mode passes: static files, `index.php`, an `action.php` route, no class-loading / undeclared-property / undefined-method errors, and no leading NUL byte.

**Root cause (fixed).** The extension used to pick the static-vs-PHP branch was read from `$path` (the URL) instead of `$fsPath` (the resolved file). `/` has no extension in the URL, but `$fsPath` had already been resolved to the directory index `.../index.php`. So `/` fell past the PHP branch into `serveStaticFile()`, which rejects any extension not in `$allowedExtensions` — 403 on the app's own home page, while `/index.php` served fine. The same mistake appeared in **two** places (`route()` and the serve path); both now read `$fsPath`.

**Also fixed: missing `Content-Type` on PHP-dispatched 200s.** A script that never calls `header()` left none set, so successful dispatches went out with no `Content-Type` at all — browsers sniff, strict clients reject. Error paths set it explicitly, which is why it only bit the success path. `dispatchToQ()` now defaults to `text/html; charset=utf-8` unless the script set one (and never on 204/304).

**Status: 32/32 passing in both modes**, stable across repeated runs.

**Native `header()` is not captured — use `Q_Response::setHeader()`.** Under the CLI SAPI PHP's `header()` is a no-op and `headers_list()` returns nothing, so a long-running CLI server cannot see those calls. This is a PHP constraint, not a server one, and unlike `php://input` it cannot be worked around with a stream wrapper. Set response headers through `Q_Response::setHeader()` or `Q::header()`; both are captured and reach the client. The suite asserts this explicitly so it will report if a future SAPI changes the behaviour.

**One header store.** `Q_Response`'s accessors delegate to `Q_WebServer_State`. An earlier refactor left `Q_Response` keeping a parallel `$_headers` array while the server read State's — so every header set through the Qbix API silently vanished from the response. The suite now round-trips a header set via `Q_Response::setHeader()` and asserts it arrives.
