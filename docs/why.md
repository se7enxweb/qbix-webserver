## 🏎️ Why Not php-fpm?

php-fpm re-bootstraps the framework on every request (10–50ms), uses ~42MB per worker, and leaks statics between requests. Qbix Server loads the framework once at startup, keeps workers persistent, resets all state between requests via Reflection and 44 function shims (about 0.5 ms for a small application, 4–5 ms for a large CMS), and shares the loaded framework between workers by copy-on-write, so each worker pays only for its own private pages: 1.3–1.9 MB with nothing loaded, about 10 MB for a full CMS ([measured](workers.md#what-a-worker-costs)).

```
php-fpm:
  Every request:
    Load PHP → include autoloader → boot framework (10–50ms)
    → run your code → send response → worker resets (statics leak)

  Cost: 42MB per worker. 4 workers on 200MB. 78 req/s at 50ms I/O.

Qbix Server:
  Once at startup:
    Load PHP → include autoloader → load ALL classes → snapshot statics
    → fork workers (inherit everything via COW)

  Every request:
    Worker receives request → run your code → restore snapshot (~0.5 ms small app, ~4.6 ms large CMS)

  Cost: 1.3–1.9 MB private per worker (bare). ~100 workers on 200MB. 1,060 req/s at 50ms I/O.
```

Three things fpm can't do: (1) persistent workers that don't leak state — Qbix resets 44 shimmed functions + all statics between requests, fpm resets nothing. (2) Many more workers on the same RAM — COW means each worker only pays for the pages it writes, not the loaded framework: a few MB each instead of 42MB, up to the event loop's ceiling of about 1,000 per pool. (3) Run unmodified blocking PHP code at high concurrency — when workers cost a few MB each, you can have enough of them that blocking I/O doesn't matter.

**The trick that makes it all work: fork after preload.** The server loads your entire framework — every class, every route, every config file — into a single parent process. Then it calls `pcntl_fork()` to create workers. The kernel doesn't copy the parent's 30MB of memory; it marks the pages copy-on-write. Workers share every loaded class, every compiled route, every cached config. They only pay for the pages they write to after the fork — the allocator's arenas, each request's objects, the application's caches — measured at 1.3–1.9 MB per worker for the server alone and about 10 MB for a full CMS. This is pure userland PHP. No kernel module, no C extension, no custom allocator. Just `pcntl_fork()` after loading everything, and the OS does the rest.

### The numbers, honestly

| | php-fpm (4w) | Swoole (4w) | **Qbix** (100w) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CPU-bound (WP-like)** | ~350 req/s | ~400 req/s | **2,294 req/s** |
| **I/O 50ms (c=200)** | 78 req/s | ~300* req/s | **1,060 req/s** |
| **I/O 200ms (c=400)** | 20 req/s | ~200–500* req/s | **488 req/s** (200w) |
| **Memory / worker** | ~42MB | ~42MB | **1.3–1.9 MB** bare, ~10 MB full CMS (COW, private) |
| **Workers on 200MB** | 4 | 4 | **~100** bare, ~15 full CMS |
| **State isolation** | Statics leak | Statics leak | **Snapshot reset (44 shims)** |
| **Unmodified WordPress** | ✅ | ❌ no adapter | **✅** (source transform) |
| **Requires extension** | — | **Yes** (PECL) | **No** |

\* Swoole numbers with `Runtime::enableCoroutine()`. Without coroutine hooks, Swoole matches fpm. WordPress and most Laravel packages use blocking I/O.

With `"forkPerRequest": true`, Qbix falls back to fork-per-request mode (7ms fork overhead) — still 2–5× fpm on I/O workloads because each child uses a few MB instead of 42MB. Useful for shared hosting with untrusted code.

> **Important:** Database connections must NOT be opened before `fork()`. A TCP connection is a single file descriptor — two processes writing to the same socket would interleave packets and corrupt the protocol. Each forked child opens its own connection. This is the same model as php-fpm (one connection per request) and is what connection poolers like PgBouncer or ProxySQL are designed for.

### Why it's actually better in practice

The throughput gap narrows significantly for real applications. A framework like Qbix with 20 loaded plugins spends 10–50ms on bootstrap per fpm request — time that Qbix Server eliminates entirely because the forked child inherits all loaded classes. For a request that does 5ms of actual work:

```
nginx + fpm:    30ms bootstrap + 5ms work           =  35ms  (29 req/s per worker) Qbix Server:    7ms fork      + 0ms bootstrap + 5ms =  12ms  (83 req/s per fork)
```

The heavier the framework, the more the fork model catches up. And the memory savings let you run 100× more of them simultaneously.

## ⚖️ vs FrankenPHP and Swoole

If you're looking beyond php-fpm, you've probably seen FrankenPHP and Swoole. Here's how they compare:

| | FrankenPHP | Swoole | Qbix Server |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Language** | Go + C (embeds PHP) | C extension for PHP | Pure PHP |
| **Install** | Download Go binary or Docker | `pecl install swoole` (compiles C) | `php qbixserver.php` — nothing to install |
| **Architecture** | Worker mode (persistent) | Coroutine-based (persistent) | Persistent workers with snapshot restore (default). Fork-per-request available for maximum isolation |
| **State leaks** | ⚠️ Possible — workers persist, must audit statics | ⚠️ Possible — must manage globals carefully | ✅ Fork mode: impossible (process dies). Octane: snapshot restores all statics/globals/superglobals between requests |
| **PHP compatibility** | Most code works, some edge cases | Many extensions incompatible, blocking I/O breaks coroutines | ✅ 100% — standard PHP, nothing unusual |
| **Memory safety** | Go runtime + PHP = complex interaction | C extension = segfault risk | PHP only = memory-safe by default |
| **Access control** | No X-Accel-Redirect equivalent | Manual implementation | ✅ Built-in X-Accel-Redirect |
| **Component cache** | No | No | ✅ X-Q-Cache-Tree — sub-page invalidation |
| **Early hints / 103** | ✅ Yes | No | Via amphp |
| **HTTP/2** | ✅ Built-in (Caddy) | ✅ Built-in | ✅ Via amphp |
| **WebSocket** | Via Mercure | ✅ Built-in | ✅ Built-in |
| **PHP throughput** (CPU-bound) | 350 req/s | ~400 req/s | **2,294 req/s** (octane 100w) |
| **PHP throughput** (same 200MB, I/O 50ms) | 78 req/s | ~300 req/s (coroutines) | **151 req/s** (fork) / **1,060 req/s** (octane 100w) |
| **PHP throughput** (same 200MB, I/O 200ms) | 20 req/s | ~200–500 req/s (coroutines) | **94 req/s** (fork) / **488 req/s** (octane 200w) |
| **Static throughput** | 10,038 req/s | 26,974 req/s | **18,311 req/s** |
| **Concurrent capacity** | Limited by worker memory | Limited by worker memory | **100–300× more** (COW, measured) |
| **WebSocket rooms** | No | Manual | ✅ Built-in — rooms are forked processes |
| **Code signing** | No | No | ✅ M-of-N manifest signing |
| **Unmodified WordPress** | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ (44-function shim) |

### The state isolation advantage

FrankenPHP and Swoole keep PHP workers alive across requests. This is fast, but it means global state, static variables, database connections, and in-memory caches **persist between unrelated requests**. This causes subtle bugs:

```php
// This leaks between requests in FrankenPHP/Swoole:
class UserService {
    private static ?User $cached = null;
    
    public static function current(): User {
        if (!self::$cached) {
            self::$cached = User::fromSession();
        }
        return self::$cached; // Returns previous user's data!
    }
}
```

Every PHP framework, library, and snippet that uses static variables, singletons, or global state becomes a potential security hole. You have to audit everything.

Qbix Server offers two modes, both of which avoid this:

**Fork mode (default):** each request forks from the preloaded parent, inherits loaded classes and config (read-only, shared via COW), runs in its own process, and dies when done. No state leaks. No audit needed. Your existing PHP code works exactly as it does on php-fpm.

**Default mode:** persistent workers handle multiple requests, but a snapshot restore resets all class statics, `$GLOBALS`, `$_GET`, `$_POST`, `$_COOKIE`, `$_SERVER`, `$_FILES`, response headers, and error state between every request — verified by 13 dedicated snapshot isolation tests. The code above would work correctly because `$cached` is restored to `null` between requests. See [reset.md](docs/reset.md) for the full reset table.

### The "just PHP" advantage

FrankenPHP requires Go tooling to build or a pre-built binary that bundles Caddy. Swoole requires compiling a C extension, which can conflict with other extensions and doesn't work on all hosting environments.

Qbix Server is a PHP file. If you can run `php -v`, you can run the server. It uses standard PHP extensions (`sockets`, `pcntl`) that come pre-installed on most systems. There's no compilation step, no foreign runtime, no binary compatibility issues.

```bash
# FrankenPHP
docker pull dunglas/frankenphp  # 150MB+ image, or build from Go source

# Swoole
pecl install swoole             # compiles C, may fail on some systems
# Then edit php.ini, restart php...

# Qbix Server
php qbixserver.php  # done
```

### When to choose what

**php-fpm** is the standard, and there's nothing wrong with it for small apps. But it tops out at ~24 workers per GB of RAM, leaks statics between requests, and every request re-bootstraps the framework. Qbix fork mode doubles its I/O throughput on the same hardware with no configuration.

**FrankenPHP** gives you HTTP/3 and automatic HTTPS via Caddy. If you need HTTP/3 today, that's the one reason. Everything else — throughput, memory, state isolation, WordPress compatibility — Qbix does better.

**Swoole** has one unique trick: coroutine fan-out within a single worker (one request making 50 parallel HTTP calls). If that's your architecture, it helps. But it requires a C extension, breaks many PHP extensions, needs framework-specific adapters, leaks state, and will never run unmodified WordPress.

**Qbix Server** beats fpm on I/O (14× throughput on the same RAM), beats Swoole on CPU-bound work (2,294 vs ~400 req/s), runs unmodified WordPress/Laravel/Symfony/Drupal with 28 shimmed functions, and adds WebSocket rooms, SSE, microservice isolation, cluster replication, code signing, and a live dashboard. No extensions, no Docker, no Go. One PHP file.
